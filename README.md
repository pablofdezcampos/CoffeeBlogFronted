# Description
- Projec to develop a front-end web page.
- Project with responsive design.
- Example of a coffee blog.

# Technologies 
- HTML5 for the sctructure and elements of the page.
- CSS3 for the styles of the elements in the page.
- In CSS3 to take a good structure I use the metodology of BEM CSS.
- Lazy Load, a pattern that consists of delaying the loading or initialization of an object until the moment of its use 

# Page Structure
- Header
- Footer
- Main Section
- Entry Section
- Contact Section
- AboutUs Section

# Development Errors
- Due to in this project I do not add a Database for the Backend, I have to repeat HTML code. That is a wrong practise.
